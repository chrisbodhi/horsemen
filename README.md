###THE HORSEMEN COMETH.

####For the serious exerciser who scoffs at poorly formatted .pdf's: an adaptation of the Horsemen training program in web app form. 

#####A word on their goals, as taken from [the original program](http://www.scribd.com/doc/61326015/Horsemen-Program):

> Our goals specifically in making this program are to be able to DL [deadlift] 2.5x, Front Squat 1.5x, Bench 1.5x, Military Press 1x our BW [bodyweight] and still be [in] the cardio shape to run 3 miles easily in under 20:00. Also, we will have a score of at least 200 on the SSST [[Secret Service Snatch Test](http://worldsstrongestlibrarian.com/2276/kettlebell-challenge-the-secret-service-snatch-test/)]. Whatever your individual goals are just tweak this program towards them in order to achieve them within 4 months.

Started on a lazy Sunday to exercise my Ruby &amp; Sinatra brains. No, I don't own any rights to the training program. Yes, I'll post a link to the Heroku app once it lives. EDIT: It (mostly) [lives](http://horsemen.herokuapp.com).

Enjoy. <3
